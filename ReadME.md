## Usage
```md
When "Add Employees" button is clicked the user will then be prompted to add the first name, last name, and salary of the employee. These prompts will be followed by another prompt asking if there are any more employees to enter. Clicking "ok" allows you to enter another employee, while clicking cancel returns the employees entered. The employees are displayed on screen and are sorted by their last names. There is also an average and random drawing conducted in the console portion. If a non-numeric value is entered for the salary, the console shows invalid salary and also does not record that employee's data.
